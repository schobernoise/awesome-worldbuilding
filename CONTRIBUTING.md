Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guidelines

- Create a pull request with your contribution.
- There are no more formal guidelines for now since this collection is not using a consistent formatting.
- The author is reserving their right to correct the formatting if needed.
- Please make sure to favor ressources that are open source and/or free to use. This is not a hard rule but it should be an exception rather than a regular occurence.
